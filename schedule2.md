We are focusing on two hackathon tracks: 
  1. "Hack the Stack: Bring Fusion+ to Etherlink" ($10,000 prize)
  2. "Expand Limit Order Protocol" ($65,000 prize)

 The project: A Cross-Chain TWAP DEX Aggregator that integrates:
   - Fusion+ Expansion (to Etherlink) 
   - Limit Order Protocol (TWAP hooks)
   - 1inch API Application

 We need to draft a 5-day milestone plan that addresses both tracks and meets their requirements.

 Key Requirements for "Hack the Stack" (Etherlink + Fusion+):
   - Deploy Solidity contracts on Etherlink.
   - Integrate/Extend 1inch Fusion+ on Etherlink.
   - README with clear instructions.

 Key Requirements for "Expand Limit Order Protocol":
   - Onchain execution of strategy (TWAP swaps).
   - Custom Limit Orders (not using the official Limit Order API).
   - Consistent commit history.

 Approach:
   We will build a system that:
     1. Allows users to place a TWAP order (split into chunks over time) via a custom Limit Order hook (for the Limit Order track).
     2. Uses 1inch Fusion+ to execute each chunk of the TWAP order, routed through Etherlink (for the Fusion+ on Etherlink track).
     3. Provides a UI to demonstrate the functionality.

 Milestone Plan (5 days):

 Day 1: Foundation & Setup
   - Set up development environment for Etherlink (Hardhat/Foundry).
   - Deploy mock tokens on Etherlink testnet and Ethereum testnet (Goerli/Sepolia).
   - Research and set up 1inch Fusion+ and Limit Order Protocol interfaces.

 Day 2: Core Smart Contracts
   - Develop the custom TWAP hook contract (for Limit Order Protocol extension) that:
        * Accepts a TWAP order (total amount, number of chunks, interval).
        * Stores the order and schedules the chunks.
   - Develop the Fusion+ integration contract on Etherlink that:
        * Can execute a swap via 1inch Fusion+ on Etherlink.
        * Handles cross-chain messaging (for orders originating on Ethereum).

 Day 3: Cross-Chain & Execution Logic
   - Build the relayer service to trigger TWAP chunks (using Chainlink Keepers or a decentralized alternative, or if time constraints, a centralized scheduler for demo).
   - Implement the execution of each chunk via 1inch Fusion+ on Etherlink.
   - Ensure bidirectional swaps (Ethereum <-> Etherlink) and handle asset bridging (using a canonical bridge or mock bridge for testing).

 Day 4: Frontend & Integration
   - Build a React frontend that:
        * Allows users to connect wallet (Ethereum and Etherlink).
        * Place TWAP orders (input tokens, output tokens, total amount, chunks, interval).
        * Display order status and execution history.
   - Integrate with 1inch APIs for token lists, prices, and swap simulation.

 Day 5: Testing, Demo, and Documentation
   - Test the entire flow: place a TWAP order on Ethereum, execute chunks on Etherlink via Fusion+, and bridge assets back if needed.
   - Record a demo video showing the process and savings (slippage reduction).
   - Write a comprehensive README with setup instructions and architecture explanation.
   - Prepare submission materials.

 Now, let's break down each day with detailed sub-milestones.

 Note: We are constrained by time, so we must focus on the core requirements and use mock bridges if necessary. We will use the Etherlink testnet and Ethereum testnets.

 Detailed Milestones:

 Day 1: Foundation & Setup
   - Sub-milestones:
        1.1. Set up Hardhat project with Etherlink configuration (using `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` and Etherlink testnet RPC).
        1.2. Deploy mock ERC20 tokens on Etherlink testnet and Ethereum Goerli.
        1.3. Research and set up interfaces for:
               - 1inch Fusion+ (AggregationRouterV5) on Etherlink: Check if available or need adaptation.
               - 1inch Limit Order Protocol (for reference, but we are building a custom hook, so we won't use the official API).
        1.4. Set up a basic Hardhat task to deploy contracts and verify on Etherlink testnet.

 Day 2: Core Smart Contracts
   - Sub-milestones:
        2.1. TWAPHook contract (for Limit Order Protocol extension):
               - Write a contract that inherits from a base limit order contract (or implements the necessary interface for custom orders).
               - Functions: 
                 - `createTWAPOrder`: User calls this to create a TWAP order. Parameters: input token, output token, total input amount, number of chunks, interval in seconds.
                 - The contract stores the order and the next execution time for each chunk.
                 - The contract must have a function to execute a chunk (to be called by the relayer/keeper).
        2.2. Fusion+ integration contract (on Etherlink):
               - Write a contract that can perform a swap on Etherlink using 1inch Fusion+.
               - This contract will be called by the TWAPHook when executing a chunk on Etherlink.
               - It should use the 1inch AggregationRouterV5 (or equivalent) with the Fusion mode.
        2.3. Cross-chain bridge adapter (simplified):
               - For the demo, we can use a mock bridge that mints/burns tokens. Alternatively, use the official bridge if available and time permits.
               - The bridge adapter contract should lock tokens on Ethereum and mint on Etherlink, and vice versa.

 Day 3: Cross-Chain & Execution Logic
   - Sub-milestones:
        3.1. Relayer service (or keeper integration):
               - Create a Node.js script that listens for TWAP orders that are due for execution.
               - For each due chunk, call the `executeChunk` function on the TWAPHook contract.
               - This script can be run locally for the demo, but design it to be run by Chainlink Keepers in production.
        3.2. Execution flow for a chunk:
               - On Ethereum: The TWAPHook contract calls the bridge to transfer the chunk amount to Etherlink.
               - On Etherlink: The bridge mints the tokens, then the Fusion+ integration contract swaps them via 1inch.
               - The output tokens are stored on Etherlink (or sent back to Ethereum via the bridge if the order is complete and the user wants on Ethereum).
        3.3. Implement the callback from Etherlink to Ethereum (for completing the order and updating status).

 Day 4: Frontend & Integration
   - Sub-milestones:
        4.1. Create a React app with:
               - Wallet connection (use Wagmi or Web3React) for both Ethereum and Etherlink.
               - A form to create a TWAP order (input token, output token, amount, chunks, interval).
               - Display active orders and their status (next chunk, progress, etc.).
        4.2. Integrate with 1inch Token API to get token lists and with Price Feed API to show expected output.
        4.3. Connect the frontend to the TWAPHook contract to place orders.

 Day 5: Testing, Demo, and Documentation
   - Sub-milestones:
        5.1. End-to-end test:
               - Place a TWAP order (e.g., 1 ETH -> USDC, 4 chunks, 10-minute interval).
               - Manually trigger the relayer to execute chunks and observe the swaps on Etherlink via 1inch Fusion+.
               - Verify the user receives the output tokens (on Etherlink or bridged back to Ethereum).
        5.2. Record a demo video (3-5 minutes) showing:
               - The user placing a TWAP order.
               - The relayer executing two chunks (show transactions on Etherscan and Etherlink block explorer).
               - The user's balance updating.
        5.3. Write README.md with:
               - Project description.
               - Setup instructions (env variables, contracts deployment, frontend start).
               - How to run the relayer and the demo.
               - Which 1inch features were used (Fusion+ on Etherlink, and the 1inch contracts/APIs).
        5.4. Prepare the GitHub repository with consistent commits (at least 3 commits per day).

 Note: We are building a prototype, so we can use simplifications (like a mock bridge and a centralized relayer) to meet the deadline.

 This plan addresses both tracks:
   - For "Hack the Stack": We are integrating Fusion+ on Etherlink for the swap execution of each chunk.
   - For "Expand Limit Order Protocol": We are building a custom TWAP strategy as a hook (without using the official Limit Order API).

 Let's write the milestones accordingly.
